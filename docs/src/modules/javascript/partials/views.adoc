You can access a single https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/reference/glossary.html#entity[Entity] with its https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/reference/glossary.html#entity_key[Entity key]. To retrieve multiple Entities, and retrieve them using an attribute other than the key, use Akka Serverless https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/reference/glossary.html#view[Views].

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: Don't Views also work using Keys? The text implies that Views only work with attributes other than the key. Did it mean to say that you can retrieve multiple entities and you can *also* retrieve them using attributes other than the key?]

A View retrieves data based on a query similar to SQL. By creating multiple Views, you can optimize each one for query performance.

Views can be defined from all of the following:

* Event Sourced Entity events
* Value Entities state changes
* Messages received from subscribing to topics on a broker

IMPORTANT: Be aware that Views are not updated immediately when Entity state changes. Akka Serverless does update Views as quickly as possible, but it is not instant and can take up to a few seconds for the changes to become visible in the query results. View updates might also take more time during failure scenarios than during normal operation.
